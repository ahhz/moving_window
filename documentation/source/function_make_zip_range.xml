  <para>A page that documents a function has the following sections.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Prototype</title>

    <para>the function's declaration.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Description</title>

    <para>A summary of what the function does.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Definition</title>

    <para>A link to the source code where the function is defined.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Type requirements</title>

    <para>Most functions in the STL are function templates. This section lists
    the requirements that must be satisfied by the function's template
    parameters. Sometimes the requirements can simply be expressed by listing
    which concept a template parameter must conform to, but sometimes they are
    more complicated and involve a relationship between two different template
    parameters. In the case of find, for example, the requirements are that
    the parameter InputIterator is a model of Input Iterator, that the
    parameter EqualityComparable is a model of Equality Comparable, and that
    comparison for equality is possible between objects of type
    EqualityComparable and objects of InputIterator's value types.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Preconditions</title>

    <para>Functions usually aren't guaranteed to yield a well-defined result
    for any possible input, but only for valid input; it is an error to call a
    function with invalid input. This section describes the conditions for
    validity.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Complexity</title>

    <para>Guarantees on the function's run-time complexity. For example,
    find's run-time complexity is linear in the length of the input
    range.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Example of use</title>

    <para>A code fragment that illustrates how to use the function.</para>
  </section>

    <title>Notes</title>

    <para>Footnotes (if any) that are referred to by other parts of the
    page.</para>
