  <para>Moving window analysis is commonly seen as a useful means of achieving
  scale-sensitive geographical analysis. The implementation of efficient
  moving window analysis on raster layers is not trivial however and
  computational difficulties may be a hurdle to appling moving windows in
  practice. The Moving Window library aims to alleviate such hurdles by
  offering concepts, functions and classess for <emphasis>generic moving
  window analysis on raster date</emphasis>. With a relatively small effort,
  users should be able to apply moving window analysis for a number of
  built-in indicators or develop and apply custom moving window indicators. At
  the moment the library is proof-of-concept and the documentation is limited
  to the use of built-in indicators. Please contact me
  (a.hagen-zanker@surrey.ac.uk) if you are interested in using this for your
  work or research.</para>
